### Fully local software for sensitive information camouflage. 



Our software detects and anonymizes private information in documents before submission to LLM/AI analysis or other third parties. 

CamoText uses custom natural language processing and text detection algorithms to hash sensitive details such as names, account numbers, contact details, crypto addresses, and more. 

Hashing is customizable and extensible by users, is entirely performed on the user's machine, and uses effectively irreversible 32 character sha256 encryption.
